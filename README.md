# Anime-Artist-with-StyleGAN2

Cartoon creators are often faced with timeline challenges to create content, and deciding the visual characteristics of a person is a time taking process. Machine learning can help us to solve this problem. The goal is to generate Anime Avatars with StyleGAN2 and get familiar with  StyleGAN2 architecture. GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) is used to generate various new content. It has some interesting applications like generating synthetic data for training, creating arts, style-transfer, translating one image to another, etc. The topic enjoys popularity due to these interesting applications.

We generated stochastic variations for distinct levels using StyleGAN2 by providing disturbance at the current layer. Our impression or character of the image is not changed by these variations, they simply allow us to make superficial changes that help in a smooth transition, these changes include hair placement, changing eye sizes, etc.
Idea is to use a generative model that can generate new content using a Pre-trained model which works on human faces, to generate anime content.
